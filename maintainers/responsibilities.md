# Maintainer responsibilities

## Join team meetings

Participate in the regular team meetings, see [meeting information and protocol](./README.md#team-meetings) for details.

If you can't participate, notify other team members.

## Monitor notifications

Watch discussions and proposals from these communication channels:

- GitHub
- Discourse
- Matrix

Maintain your entry in the [`CODEOWNERS`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) file in the respective repository.
GitHub will then request reviews for pull requests that change files you own.

Set the notification level on the [Development > Documentation](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/dev/documentation/25) Discourse category to "watching".

Join the [Nix\* Documentation](https://matrix.to/#/#docs:nixos.org) Matrix room and enable relevant notifications.

Respond to `@` mentions on GitHub, Discourse, and Matrix within reasonable time, even if you cannot deal with the issue due to time constraints or other priorities.

## Provide guidance

Guide potential contributors, by:

- taking questions on the Discourse Help category
- encouraging question authors to raise issues on GitHub if needed
- guiding them to make pull requests to solve their problems

Make sure to reserve time for reviewing pull requests that fall within your area of interest or expertise.

## Take ownership of issues, pull requests, and source code

As a maintainer, you are responsible for the code you approve and merge.
It is your responsibility to follow-up on bugs and regressions caused by this code.
